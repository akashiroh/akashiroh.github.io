    - title: Emulating the Global Change Analysis Model
      logo: /assets/imgs/gcam_logo.png
      summary: Collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and Joint Global Change Research Institute to train a model that is able to emulate the outputs and sensitivities of GCAM.
      details: We explore two GCAM ensemble designs, {__renewable energy__, __food scarcity__}, by training a neural network to emulate each case study. We explore the relationship between training samples and maximum model generalizability to limit the upfront compute needed to run GCAM simulations to produce the training data, decreasing the simulation time by 50%. This efficient emulator is used to discover the optimal training dataset by sampling the most uncertain regions of the input space, further decreasing training samples needed, and is used to discover the optimal input configuration that yields desirable climate futures.

    - title: Semantic Segmentation for Archaeology
      logo: /assets/imgs/arch_logo.png
      summary: Collaboration with Archaeology department at WWU to fine-tune a semantic segmentation model.
      details: |
        We fine-tune te state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model on aerial lidar data for binary classification of pixels. We train on 50m x 50m patches of data on elevation, number of returns, intensity, and relative elevation with varying radii. We are training and computing metrics between our predictions and ground-surveyed data rather than lidar derived data, making this task specifically noisy. We achieve 0.56 F1 score and 0.41 mIoU.

    - title: Computational Animal Welfare
      logo: /assets/imgs/zoo_logo.png
      summary: Collaboration with the Woodland Park Zoo to utilize video object tracking and image object detection to track animal behavior and enclosure usage.
      details: |
        We deploy a variant of Meta AI's SAM2 to track animals via surveillance footage and a fine-tuned YOLO model to detect the initial bounding box of the animal.

      summary: WWU CS 481 -- Deep Learning; Develop and train a model for machine translation between English graphemes and Arpabet phonemes.
      details: This project was a part of a group assignment in the Deep Learning course. Each group member had their own task to complete and compete against the rest of the class. My model achieved 9.89% "phoneme" error rate and recieved the second highest performace in a class of 35+ students.

      summary: WWU CSCI 597F -- Robotics; Designed a Rubik's Cube Solving Robot
      details: Implemented a Rubik's Cube solver with a constrained set of moves consistent with our robot design. Designed a 3d-printed CAD motor housing and built and tested this robot. This was a group project for Robotics where I implemented the solver and used computer vision to use a webcam to scan the intial state of the robot.
